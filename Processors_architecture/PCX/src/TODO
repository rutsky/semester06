 * Fix incorrect optimization about:
  > if (dword & 0xC0C0C0C0)
  and 
  > dword |= dword1
 * In 7th optimization case of `count == 1' not handled as in 8th optimization.
 * Case when decoding repeating bytes are outside of image is very rare and should not be 
 (mat not be handled, just `return').
